## UI/UX Standards to Apply

1. **Consistent Spacing**: Use Tailwind's spacing scale (4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24)
2. **Color Palette**: Pink-600, Purple-600, Blue-600 gradients
3. **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with bold headings
4. **Animations**: Smooth transitions, floating elements, hover effects
5. **Mobile Responsive**: All pages must work on mobile, tablet, desktop
6. **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios, semantic HTML
7. **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and loading indicators
8. **Error States**: Clear error messages with recovery options
9. **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no data exists
10. **Micro-interactions**: Button hover effects, ripple effects, smooth transitions

## Next Steps

1. Review each page file for UI/UX consistency
2. Apply high-end design standards across all pages
3. Ensure responsive design on all screens
4. Add smooth animations and transitions
5. Test all user flows and interactions
6. Document any remaining issues
